## Hi 👋

I’m Amine — a computer science student.
I’m fascinated by how systems work and how data shapes the world, transforming the economy, healthcare, and the environment — all of which I’m applying to build a future in data science.

Alongside my studies, I’m a programmer who enjoys breaking down problems, writing clean logic, and continuously improving how things are built. I’m especially drawn to analytical thinking, optimization, and learning tools that scale.

Fun Facts:

• Fluent in four languages 🌍

• Obsessed with data, AI, and systems

• Love building projects and solving problems

• Gym enthusiast 💪
